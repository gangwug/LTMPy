# LTMPy
An in silico genome-wide screen for circadian clock strength (A python version). LTM is an in silico screen to infer genetic influences on circadian clock function. LTM uses natural variation in gene expression data and directly links gene expression variation to clock strength independent of longitudinal data.


## Usage
Follow the demo shown in 'run_LTMPy_example.py'. 

## Advice for LTMPy users
1. Compared to the original R version of LTM (LTMR[https://github.com/gangwug/LTMR]), LTMPy is relatvie slower, even with parallel computing. 
2. There may be some minor differences between the LTMPy and LTMR, mainly at two steps, LTMprep and LTMheat.
